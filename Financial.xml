            <title>Introduction</title>
            
            <p>
            In today’s world, money can be used for a number of purposes. For this set of notes, we will be concerned with the use
            of money as an investment. In general, when one has monetary resources then they can use those resources to purchase supplies,
            equipment, manpower, etc. in order to generate goods and services for which others will pay. That is, they can use the money to
            make money.</p>
            <p>When one however takes a sum of money and allows someone else to use it then they forgo the opportunities described above and
            therefore incurs a loss of the opportunity to earn revenue on those funds. In order to compensate the person lending the money for
            that potential loss, an additional sum of money is added to the amount when the funds are eventually repaid. This additional sum is what
            we call interest. 
            </p>   
            <p>Some communities may have a general negative attitude for charging interest on loans. It is certainly acceptable for one to lend
            money out and not expect or require interest when repaid. Indeed, is is acceptable for one to just give money away to those that they
            might choose to do so. Actually, when lending money to friends it might be best to just consider the loan a gift and repayment a blessing
            since many friendships have been destroyed over the lack of repayment or the terms of repayment for borrowed funds.
            </p>
            <p>For these notes, we will cover the case for how to properly calculate interest on loans and leave it to the
            reader regarding whether they want to use these mathematical formulas or not.
            </p>

			<subsection>
				<title>Simple Interest</title>
				<p>To determine the amount of interest one should pay for the use of someone else’s money, one model is to base that
				amount of interest to that it is directly proportional to the length of time over which the money is lent as well as directly
				proportional to some rate which is based upon the borrower’s perceived ability to repay and based upon current market conditions.
				To satisfy these constraints leads to the model for Simple Interest. </p>
				<theorem><title>Simple Interest Formula</title>
					<statement>Using simple interest, <m>I = P \cdot i \cdot t</m> and so <m>A = P + P \cdot i \cdot t</m> or <m>A = P(1 + i \cdot t)</m></statement>
				</theorem>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection>
				<title>Compound Interest</title>
				<p>When using simple interest, one only considers the value of the resource at the beginning of time and then again at the end. H
				owever, the lender does without use of the funds at all times during the period of the investment. Indeed, if the original investment
				were to only be lent for 1/2 of the original time period, then the borrower would have to pay the accrued interest at that time (1/2 as much
				as planned) and then perhaps re-borrow the money plus the paid interest for the remaining time. However, for the second half, the amount borrowed
				would include the additional interest that had to be paid.  Continuing this by shortening the period (say, 1/4’s or 1/12’s) would allow
				for the amount borrowed at the end of each period to grow. The net effect of this recalculation over many periods gives rise to what is 
				know as Compound Interest.</p>
				<theorem><title>Future Value of Compound Interest</title>
					<statement><p>Using Compound interest over t years, compounding m times per year, 
					yields <m>\displaystyle A = P(1+r)^n</m> with <m>n=mt</m> and <m>r = i/m</m></p>
					</statement>
					<proof>
					<p>To determine the future value of a deposit of size <m>P</m> over several periods, utilize the simple interest formula for a single
					period to determine the value of the deposit after that one period. Then, take that new (slightly larger) amount as a starting point
					for a new simple interest calculation covering the next period. Repeat for n periods to get the ending value over all periods.</p>
					<p>To do this, let’s denote the present value after k periods as <m>P_k</m> and note that <m>P_0 = P</m>.  Then,</p>
					<md>
						<mrow>P_1 &amp; = P_0(1+r)</mrow>
						<mrow>P_2 &amp; = P_1(1+r) = P_0(1+r)^2 </mrow>
						<mrow>P_3 &amp; = P_2(1+r) = P_0(1+r)^3</mrow>
						<mrow>P_4 &amp; = P_3(1+r) = P_0(1+r)^4</mrow>
						<mrow> &amp; =  ...</mrow>
						<mrow>P_{n-1} &amp; = P_{n-2}(1+r) = P_0(1+r)^{n-1}</mrow>
						<mrow>P_n &amp; = P_{n-1}(1+r) = P_0(1+r)^n</mrow>
					</md>
					<p>Noting that <m>A = P_n </m> and <m>P = P_0 </m> gives</p>
					<md>
						<mrow>A &amp; = P(1+r)^n</mrow>
					</md>
					</proof>
				</theorem>
				
				<corollary><title>Present Value of Compound Interest</title>
					<statement>Given a future value <m>A</m>, the present value using Compound Interest is given by <m>\displaystyle P = A(1+r)^{-n}</m></statement>
					<proof><p>Take the formula above and solve for P. This gives,</p>
						<p><m>\displaystyle P = A(1+r)^{-n}</m></p>

					<title>Effective Interest Rates</title>
					<p>The published yearly interest rate is also called the “nominal” rate.
					As one considers investments (and especially annuities) one may desire compounding the value of money over different compounding time 
					frames. So, comparing raw interest rates becomes muddled since the same nominal rate can result in wildly different actual growth amounts.
					To avoid confusion we determine what is known as an effective interest rate
					by computing the increase of 1 dollar over one year’s time span. This results in the effective rate <m>r_e</m></p>
					<md>
						<mrow>P + I = 1 + 1 \cdot r_e \cdot 1 = 1(1+r)^m</mrow>
						<mrow>r_e = (1+r)^m - 1</mrow>
					</md>
					<example><title>Comparing different compounding periods</title>
						<p>Determine the effective rate of compounding daily that is equivalent to compounding monthly at an annual rate of <m>r_{12}=4%</m>.  
						To do so, first compute the effective interest rate of the monthly compounding (since you know its stated rate) using 
						<m> \displaystyle (1+ \frac{0.04}{12})^{12} - 1</m>.  Then, use the effective rate
						formula set equal to this effective value and work your way backward to find the annual rate <m>r_{365}</m>for compounding daily.</p>
						<md>
							<mrow>(1+ \frac{0.04}{12})^{12} - 1 &amp; = (1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365})^{365} - 1 </mrow>
							<mrow>(1+ \frac{0.04}{12})^{12} &amp; = (1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365})^{365} </mrow>
							<mrow>\ln(1+ \frac{0.04}{12})^{12} &amp; = \ln(1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365})^{365} </mrow>
							<mrow>12 \ln(1+ \frac{0.04}{12}) &amp; = 365 \ln(1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365}) </mrow>
							<mrow>\frac{12}{365} \ln(1+ \frac{0.04}{12}) &amp; = \ln(1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365}) </mrow>
							<mrow>e^{\frac{12}{365} \ln(1+ \frac{0.04}{12})} &amp; = 1+ \frac{r_{365}}{365} </mrow>
							<mrow>365(e^{\frac{12}{365} \ln(1+ \frac{0.04}{12})} - 1) &amp; = r_{365} </mrow>
						</md>
						<p>and the rest is arithmetic.  Easily, the above example generalizes to other compounding periods:</p>
						<md>
							<mrow>(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1})^{m_1} - 1 &amp; = (1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2})^{m_2} - 1 </mrow>
							<mrow>(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1})^{m_1} &amp; = (1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2})^{m_2} </mrow>
							<mrow>\ln(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1})^{m_1} &amp; = \ln(1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2})^{m_2} </mrow>
							<mrow>m_1 \ln(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1}) &amp; = m_2 \ln(1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2}) </mrow>
							<mrow>\frac{m_1}{m_2} \ln(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1}) &amp; = \ln(1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2}) </mrow>
							<mrow>e^{\frac{m_1}{m_2} \ln(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1})} &amp; = 1+ \frac{r_2}{m_2} </mrow>
							<mrow>m_2(e^{\frac{m_1}{m_2} \ln(1+ \frac{r_1}{m_1})} - 1) &amp; = r_2 </mrow>
						</md>

					<title>Continuous Compounding of Interest</title>
					<p>As interest is compounded more often, the effective interest rate tends to increase. Indeed, as m increases then the time between
					periods decreases and becomes infinitesimal.  We would then say that interest is compounded continuously. As it turns out, we will 
					see that there is a limit to the effective rate as m grows.</p>

				<title>Annuities</title>
				<p>In the discussion above, investments considered a single “deposit” at the beginning of the time period and a single “payout” at the 
				end of the time period. In many real-life situations, one may desire an option where there is perhaps a single deposit at the beginning of 
				time and then a series of (perhaps equal) payouts over the time period. Such a sequence of payments is called an annuity.</p>

					<p>To determine the breakdown regarding interest paid and reduction of principle for any given payment in an annuity, one can

					<title>Annuity with annual cost of living increases</title>
					<p>Generally, an annuity is a sequence of equal payments over time. In reality, people like to use an annuity to
					fund retirement and one might want to allow for the payments to increase each year to keep up with the cost of living.
					Another alternative occurs perhaps when one might purchase a house and not be able to make the necessary payments at the 
					beginning of the annuity but expects to earn more and therefore be able to pay more in later years of the loan. To analyze
					these situations takes a bit more care since the compounding period and the (annual) increases are not necessarily on the 
					same time frames.  To fix this, the idea is to convert the periodic payments in terms of years by converting, for example,
					the 12 monthly payments into a single but equivalent lump sum payment at the end of the year.  So long as the lump sum payment
					is mathematically equivalent to the sequence of payments then all is equivalent. Then, we can tack on the desired cost of living 
					increase to these annualized payments and use that rate of increase for the yearly annuity.</p>
					<theorem>
						<title>Yearly Annuity with Cost of Living Adjustment</title>
							<statement>The Present Value of a yearly annuity initially in the amount of <m>R_y</m> which includes yearly cost-of-living adjustments is

							<m>r_e</m> = effective yearly rate, a = yearly cost-of-living increase, t = number of years.</statement>
							<proof>
								<p>To save some time, let’s define <m>z = \frac{1+a}{1+r_e}</m>.  Notice that if the cost of living increase (a) is greater than
								the effective rate of interest <m>r_e</m> then the net investment will grow with a interest rate related to <m>z-1 \gt 0</m>.  
								On the other
								hand, if the cost of living increase is less than the effective rate of interest, then the net investment wil grow at an interest
								rate <m>z-1 \lt 0</m>...that it, your periodic payments will not be keeping up with inflation.  Notice in the formulas below that this 
								quotient z essentially replaces the standard compound growth factor (1+r). </p>

					</theorem>
					
					<p>Obviously, one may want to receive these payments more often than once a year but account for yearly adjustments to the payments.
					In this situation, one should determine the size R of the m payments in the first year and then find the accumulated value of those 
					payments at the end of one year. Taking that value as R in the theorem above gives the present value of the cost-of-living adjusted

				<title>Perpetual Annuities</title>
				<p>In general, an annuity is a regular set of payments over a set period of time. However, sometimes you might want to set up an investment
				which will return a set of regular payments forever. This is called a “perpetuity” or a “perpetual annuity”. To determine the amount to invest
				to set up such an instrument, it is best to consider the present value at the beginning of time and require that the investment grow over only
				one time period to the amount which needs to be dispersed.  That is, after one period the investment grows by the amount of the desired payment:</p>
				<md>
					<mrow> A &amp; = P + R = P(1+r)</mrow>
					<mrow> R &amp; = P(1+r) - P</mrow>
					<mrow> &amp; = Pr</mrow>
				</md>
				<p>If you want to consider money compounded more often than the payment period (say yearly payments but investments compounded m times per year</p>
				<md>
					<mrow> A &amp; = P + R = P(1+r)^m</mrow>
					<mrow> R &amp; = P(1+r)^m - P</mrow>
					<mrow> &amp; = P((1+r)^m - 1)</mrow>
				</md>
				<p>So, if you want to have a set of regular payments of R dollars each year, then set aside an investment of 
				<m>\displaystyle P = \frac{R}{(1+r)^m - 1}</m></p>

        <section><title>Bonds</title>
        	<p>A bond is a financial instrument that is often utilized to finance capital needs. Indeed, the lender often utilizes the sale of such
        	an instrument to invest in long-term productivity-increasing items.  Indeed, the bond often requires that the issuer of the bond utilized
        	the bond proceeds for some designated project. In return for the money paid to purchase the bond, the purchaser (bond-holder)
        	if promised the principle back plus interest. The rate of interest charged is often fixed but can also be variable.</p>
        	<p>Some terms:
        	<ul>
				<li>Maturity Value = Promised repayment future value</li>
				<li>Coupon = Percentage of annual interest paid during the time span of the bond.</li>
				<li>Price = Present Value of the Bond’s Maturity Value</li>
				<li>Yield = Total Interest Earned</li>
				<li>Par Bonds = An instrument in which yield equals coupon.</li>
				<li>Discount Bonds = An instrument in which the yield is greater than the coupon.</li>
				<li>Premium Bonds = An instrument in which the yield is less than the coupon.</li>
				<li>Capital Appreciation Bonds = An instrument which pays no interest until maturity.</li>
				<li>Callable Bonds = An instrument which can be redeemed by the issuer before the actual maturity date.</li>
				<li>Basis Point = one hundredth of one percent yield.</li>
				
        	</ul>
        	</p>
        	
        	<subsection><title>Interesting Facts about Bonds</title>
        	<p>Price and Yield vary in opposite directions. As the price of a bond increases, the difference between price and maturity value 
        	diminishes and therefore yield goes down. As the price decreases, the difference increases and therefore yield goes up.</p>
        	<p>Fixed rate bonds generally presume a 360-day year. Variable rate bonds presume actual days elapsed.</p>
        	</subsection>
        	
        	<p>The bond yield, which is a measure of the income generated by a bond, is calculated as the interest divided by the 
        	price. Therefore, if a 10,000 dollar bond with 10% annual Coupons (probably broken up into two semi-annual payments of
        	500 dollars each) is selling at 10,000 dollars, or par, the coupon payment 
        	is equal to 10%, i.e. the Yield. However bond prices can be affected by market conditions and so may fluctuate. As they do
        	so does the yield. </p>
        	
        	<p>In this example, if the market price fluctuated and valued your bond to be worth 9,000 dollars, your yield would now 
        	be 11.11% (1000/9000), but the 500 semi-annual coupon payments would not change. Conversely, if the bond price were to 
        	shoot up to 11000, your yield would decrease to 9.09% (1000/11000), but again, you would still receive the same 
        	500 dollar semi-annual coupon payments.</p>
        	
        	<example><title>Zero Coupon Bond Purchase Price</title>
        	<p>A bond with no coupons is valued as a normal compound investment with the Maturity Value the specified future value.
        	To compute the purchase price of a 20 year 5000 dollar bond with yearly rate of 4.95%</p>

        	<theorem><title> Accumulated Value for Annual Coupon Bond</title>
        	<statement>Total Accumulated Value<m> = P(1 + r_{eff} \cdot t)</m></statement>
				<proof>
					<p>A bond with annual coupons will pay a simple interest coupon each year in the amount of <m>P \cdot r_{eff}</m>,
					 where <m>r_{eff}</m> is the effective annual interest rate.  Since the interest is paid out each year then 
					 there is no
					compounding effect and so the total value including interest of the bond follows a simple interest model with 
					Total Amount Accumulated <me> = P + P \cdot r_{eff} \cdot t = P(1 + r_{eff} \cdot t)</me>.</p>
				</proof>
        	</theorem>

        	<example>
        	<p>Consider a 20 year 9% bond with annual coupons purchased in 1998 for <m>\$ 93000</m>. The amount of each  coupon  
        	is the same <m>\$ 93000 \cdot 0.09 = \$ 8370</m>.  So, by 2012 the accumulated interest would have been 
        	<m>8370 \cdot 14</m> years = 117180 dollars.  For the entire length of the bond, the total amount accumulated by 2018
        	would be <m>\$ 93000(1+0.09 \cdot 20) = \$ 260,400 </m>.</p>

        	</statement>
        	<proof>
        		<p>The yearly coupon value equals <m>F \cdot r_{bond}</m> 
        		broken up into m payments of size <m>R = F \frac{r_{bond}}{m}</m>.  These coupons can be thought of as a regular 
        		annuity with <m>n = m \cdot t</m> payments and finding the present value of these yields the second part of this

        		<p>The maturity value also is factored into the price by using the compound interest formulas with the nominal rate

        	<subsection><title>Calculating Current Yield</title>
				<p>The current yield CY is the return (as a percentage) of the annual coupon payment. This yield determines 
				what percentage of the actual dollar coupon payment is of the price the investor pays for the bond.</p>
				<me>CY = 100 \cdot \frac{\text{Annual Interest Paid}}{\text{Market Price}}</me>
				<example>
					<p>Suppose you purchase a bond with par value 5000 dollars for 4950 dollars with a coupon rate of 4%.  Then, it’s current yield:</p>
					<me>CY = 100 \cdot \frac{5000 \cdot 0.04}{4950} = 4.0404</me>
				</example>
				<p>The computation above does not include any possible gains or losses if the bond were bought at a discount or premium. 
				Since the comparison of the bond price to its par value is a factor that affects the actual current yield, unless the
				purchaser pays par value for the bond then the above formula would give a slightly inaccurate picture. To correct this, 
				investors can modify the current yield formula by adding the result of the current yield to the gain or loss the price 
				gives the investor: [(Par Value – Bond Price)/Years to Maturity]. 
				The modified current yield formula then takes into account the discount or premium at which the investor bought the bond: </p>
				<me>CY = 100 \cdot \frac{\text{Annual Coupon}}{\text{Market Price}} + 
				          \frac{\text{Maturity Value - Market Price}}{\text{Years Till Maturity}}</me>

				<example>
					<p>Suppose our bond above matures in 60 months and has a coupon payment of 10 dollars.  Then</p>
					<me>CY = 100 \cdot \frac{10}{4950} + \frac{5000-4950}{5} = 10.2020</me>
					<p>The adjusted current yield of 10.20% is higher than the current yield of 4.04% because the bond's discounted price 
					(4950 instead of 5000) gives the investor more of a gain on the investment</p>
