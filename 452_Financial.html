</h4>
<p>
            In today’s world, money can be used for a number of purposes. For this set of notes, we will be concerned with the use
            of money as an investment. In general, when one has monetary resources then they can use those resources to purchase supplies,
            equipment, manpower, etc. in order to generate goods and services for which others will pay. That is, they can use the money to
            make money.</p>
<p>When one however takes a sum of money and allows someone else to use it then they forgo the opportunities described above and
            therefore incurs a loss of the opportunity to earn revenue on those funds. In order to compensate the person lending the money for
            that potential loss, an additional sum of money is added to the amount when the funds are eventually repaid. This additional sum is what
            we call interest. 
            </p>
<p>Some communities may have a general negative attitude for charging interest on loans. It is certainly acceptable for one to lend
            money out and not expect or require interest when repaid. Indeed, is is acceptable for one to just give money away to those that they
            might choose to do so. Actually, when lending money to friends it might be best to just consider the loan a gift and repayment a blessing
            since many friendships have been destroyed over the lack of repayment or the terms of repayment for borrowed funds.
            </p>
<p>For these notes, we will cover the case for how to properly calculate interest on loans and leave it to the
            reader regarding whether they want to use these mathematical formulas or not.

</h4>
<p>To determine the amount of interest one should pay for the use of someone else’s money, one model is to base that
				amount of interest to that it is directly proportional to the length of time over which the money is lent as well as directly
				proportional to some rate which is based upon the borrower’s perceived ability to repay and based upon current market conditions.
				To satisfy these constraints leads to the model for Simple Interest. </p>

<p>When using simple interest, one only considers the value of the resource at the beginning of time and then again at the end. H
				owever, the lender does without use of the funds at all times during the period of the investment. Indeed, if the original investment
				were to only be lent for 1/2 of the original time period, then the borrower would have to pay the accrued interest at that time (1/2 as much
				as planned) and then perhaps re-borrow the money plus the paid interest for the remaining time. However, for the second half, the amount borrowed
				would include the additional interest that had to be paid.  Continuing this by shortening the period (say, 1/4’s or 1/12’s) would allow
				for the amount borrowed at the end of each period to grow. The net effect of this recalculation over many periods gives rise to what is 
				know as Compound Interest.</p>

<p>As one considers investments (and especially annuities) one may desire compounding the value of money over different compounding time 
					frames. So, comparing raw interest rates becomes muddled. To avoid confusion we determine what is known as an effective interest rate (or
					nominal interest rate) by computing the effective increase of 1 dollar over one year’s time span. This results in the effective rate \(r_e\)</p>\begin{gather}
P + I = 1 + 1 \cdot r_e \cdot 1 = 1(1+r)^m\notag\\

<p>Determine the effective rate of compounding daily that is equivalent to compounding monthly at an annual rate of \(r_{12}=4%\).  
						To do so, first compute the effective interest rate of the monthly compounding (since you know its stated rate) using 
						\( \displaystyle (1+ \frac{0.04}{12})^{12} - 1\).  Then, use the effective rate
						formula set equal to this nominal value and work your way backward to find the annual rate \(r_{365}\)for compounding daily.</p>\begin{align}

<p>In the discussion above, investments considered a single “deposit” at the beginning of the time period and a single “payout” at the 
				end of the time period. In many real-life situations, one may desire an option where there is perhaps a single deposit at the beginning of 
				time and then a series of (perhaps equal) payouts over the time period. Such a sequence of payments is called an annuity.</p>

<p>To determine the breakdown regarding interest paid and reduction of principle for any given payment in an annuity, one can

<p>In general, an annuity is a regular set of payments over a set period of time. Howveer, sometimes you might want to set up an investment
				which will return a set of regular payments forever. This is called a “perpetuity” or a “perpetual annuity”. To determine the amount to invest
				to set up such an instrument, it is best to consider the present value at the beginning of time and require that the investment grow over only
				one time period to the amount which needs to be dispersed.  That is, after one period the investment grows by the amount of the desired payment:</p>\begin{align}
 A &amp; = P + R = P(1+r)\notag\\
 R &amp; = P(1+r) - P\notag\\
 &amp; = Pr\notag
\end{align}<p>If you want to consider money compounded more often than the payment period (say yearly payments but investments compounded m times per year</p>\begin{align}
 A &amp; = P + R = P(1+r)^m\notag\\
 R &amp; = P(1+r)^m - P\notag\\
 &amp; = P((1+r)^m - 1)\notag
\end{align}<p>So, if you want to have a set of regular payments of R dollars each year, then set aside an investment of 
				\(\displaystyle P = \frac{R}{(1+r)^m - 1}\)</p></section></section>
